            <p> Abdul Razzaq</p>
           <span>Born 2 December 1979</span>
        </div>
    </div>
 <p class="post-text">Abdul Razzaq made his One Day International debut in November 1996, against Zimbabwe, but had to wait just over three years to make his Test cricket debut for Pakistan, eventually doing so against Australia in Brisbane in November 1999. 
    <!-- In the 1999â€“2000 Carlton and United Series, he rose to fame and was named man of the series for his all round performance. During a match in Hobart against India, Abdul Razzaq scored a half century and took five wickets. In the same tournament, he hit former Australian fast bowler, Glenn McGrath for 5 fours, which totalled to 20 runs in one over. -->
     <!-- Abdul Razzaq also performed well with the ball, his most noticeable stint was in the Coca-Cola Champions Trophy 1999 against Sri Lanka in Sharjah, October 1999. Pakistan were bowled out for 196, with Abdul Razzaq remaining not out on 7. However, Abdul Razzaq proved to be more than capable with his all round skills as he took his first five wicket haul, dismissing Romesh Kaluwitharana, Mahela Jayawardene, Suresh Perera, Chaminda Vaas and Chamara Silva to finish with match figures of 5/31, meaning that Sri Lanka were also bowled out for 196 resulting in a tied match, having once been at 157/2. Former captain Wasim Akram praised Abdul Razzaq's ability with the ball, citing that he was emerging to be one of the best all rounders in the world. Abdul Razzaq's astonishing nine-ball spell, which he took four for nought helped snatch a tie from what seemed a certain Sri Lankan victory, finishing as the man of the match for his performance.</p>  -->

    </div>
<p>In 2006, Asif was involved in controversy after he tested positive for anabolic steroid Nandrolone, leading to the imposition of a ban which was later overturned on appeal. He was later withdrawn from Pakistan's World Cup squad with an unrelated injury. 
    <!-- Further cricket controversy followed when he was detained in Dubai suspected of having drugs on his person and was then found to have tested positive for a banned substance during the Indian Premier League.  
    <!-- In August 2010 he was accused by the News of the World of deliberately bowling no-balls in return for payment from a betting syndicate.[3][4] On 5 February 2011 a 3-man tribunal, appointed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) gave the verdict that he was to be banned for 7 years, with 2 of those suspended if no further offences were committed. In November 2011, Asif was convicted, along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Amir, of conspiracy charges relating to spot-fixing.</p> -->
